          <li>
            <strong>1933 -</strong> Leaves his family's farm to attend the

          <li>
            <strong>1935 -</strong> Has to stop school and save up more money.
            Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving
            Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left
            scars on me."
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1937 -</strong> Finishes university and takes a job in the

          <li>
            <strong>1941 -</strong> Tries to enroll in the military after the
